# Testing notes:

- Visibility toggle is now in the Lighting Controls tool layer.
- App will pin above the Players list, or can be freely placed elsewhere.
- Darkness sync is a per-scene setting, toggled in Scene Config.
- If enabled in SmallTime's settings, full sync with About Time is now supported.
