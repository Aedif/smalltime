# SmallTime

*A small module for displaying and controlling the current time of day.*

### How to Use

There's a show/hide toggle in the Lighting Controls tool layer:

![Toggle Control](doc/Toggle_Control.png)

Use the forward/back buttons to change the time, or drag the sun/moon icon (non-GM users will not have these controls):

You can position the window anywhere you like with the drag handle at the bottom, or pin it just above the Players list:

For each scene, you can choose whether or not to link the time to the scene's Darkness Level:

![Scene_Config](doc/Scene_Config.png)

If you have [About Time](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/about-time) enabled, you can choose to sync with its time and date:

### Settings

There are a number of settings you can change:

### Languages

The settings text is only in English currently, but I'm happy to accept and implement translations.
