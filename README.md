### How to Use

There's a show/hide toggle in the Lighting Controls tool layer:

Use the forward/back buttons to change the time, or drag the sun/moon icon (non-GM users will not have these controls):

You can position the window anywhere you like with the drag handle at the bottom, or pin it just above the Players list:

For each scene, you can choose whether or not to link the time to the scene's Darkness Level:

If you have [About Time](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/about-time) enabled, you can choose to sync with its time and date. Clicking on the time will toggle the date display; Shift-clicking the time will toggle the realtime clock (as configured in About Time).
